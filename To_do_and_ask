2. HTML page for viewing the databases
3. See if db files are directly downloadable.
4. Import section must talk with Nikhil's php code 
and list down all the available question banks. User chooses
one from the activity, initiating its download and overwriting
the existing DB.
    Pros:
    1. Simple to implement and we have achieved at least the
    level required in the mobile
    Cons:
    1. User can't take multiple quizzes
    2. If he needs to take another quiz, he has to download the
    other one.
    Solution: Go with this method and the quiz chooser shows all 
    the details.
 5. Import_user must go to the webpage,
 2 times duplex communication
 	1. User says import
 	2. Server says I have these
 	3. User says I want this
 	4. Server says take it and go.   
    
No Man's Land
